			<p style="border:5px; border-color: black; font-size: 150%; ">Dear RCMP, <br>

			I wish to lodge a complaint against the lobbying firm ‘Dickens and Madson’ and their employee Ari Ben-Menashe. They have announced that they have been engaged by the Tatmadaw (the Burmese military) in a public relations capacity.

			Although the democratically elected government of Burma has been illegally overthrown by the Tatmadaw, they have still managed to assemble the CRPH, a committee that represents the National League for Democracy, the ousted ruling party. This committee has designated the Tatmadaw as a terrorist organisation following their egregious violations of human rights in the past weeks.

			Therefore ‘Dickens and Madson’ has entered into an agreement with a terrorist organisation, and one which is fully expected to be called to the ICC to answer charges of genocide (against the Rohingya).

			I am not an expert on Canadian law but I do urge you to investigate this situation as a matter of urgency. <br>

			<br>Best regards,
			<br>(Your name)</p>
